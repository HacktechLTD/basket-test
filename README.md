This Nick Grant's code for a technical test, to calculate the total cost of a basket of
fruit.

Cucumber has been used to test the implementation algorithm, and the test definition can
be found under:
    /src/test/resources/com/rbccm/basketcalculator/calculate.feature

There are 7 scenarios tested, with 14 test steps.

To run the tests, Java 8 and Maven should be set up on the path, then from the project
root simply run:
    mvn test
